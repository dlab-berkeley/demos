**Learn how AI actually works—no coding required**

We just launched a new set of interactive demos that explain key computational concepts through hands-on exploration:

- How transformers use attention to understand language
- What TF-IDF actually measures (and why it matters for text analysis)
- How word embeddings capture meaning
- The basics of web scraping and APIs

These browser-based tutorials are designed for researchers who want to understand the methods before diving into code. No installation needed—just open and explore.

Try them out: https://dlab.berkeley.edu/demos

**Caption:**

How do AI models understand language?

We built interactive demos that let you explore:
→ Transformer attention mechanisms
→ Word embeddings
→ TF-IDF text analysis
→ Web scraping basics

No code. No installation. Just click and learn.
